# Fundamentals of Programming Languages

This repository contains all assignments developed for the Fundamentals of Programming Languages course at FCUL (Faculty of Sciences - University of Lisbon), lectured by [Vasco T. Vasconcelos](https://github.com/vmvasconcelos).

## Course Summary

The course is divided into two main parts:

1. Formal foundations of programming languages (operational semantics, types, proofs)
2. Advanced concepts in programming languages and types

## Assignments & Grades

### Individual Assignments

- A1: `2.9/3.0`
- A2: `2.7/3.0`
- A3: `2.9/3.5`
- A4: `3.5/3.5`
- A5: `3.0/3.5`
- A6: `3.2/3.5`

**Final Grade:** `18/20`

Assignments consist of:

- Formal definitions and proofs
- Programming assignments implementing relations or advanced concepts

- Untyped system (arithmetic expressions, lambda calculus)
- Simple types with extensions
- Recursive types
- Polymorphism
- Linear types
- Session types
